Hello, I am Spacey Galileo
I am new to software and coding, more of a hardware guy.
I'm interested in modularized phones and what ever comes to mind. More of a Wozinak fan than a Jobs.
Currenting in Low Earth Orbit... I can't see the Great Wall of China when I pass over, still breath taking.


Burn Metaverse. Mark, I'm still waiting for a reply.


Cheers.
